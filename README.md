# TEXT REVIEW ANALYSER

This project is based on Natural Language Processing and with the help of this NLP model, we can easily identify whether the customer review is positive or not. This can be easily used to rate any product based upon the reviews given by customers for the same product.

# INTRODUCTION TO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software. The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers.

# Natural Language

In computing, natural language refers to a human language such as English, Russian, German, or Japanese as distinct from the typically artificial command or programming language with which one usually talks to a computer. The term usually refers to a written language but might also apply to spoken language.

# LIBRARIES USED

1. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language. It was developed by Steven Bird and Edward Loper in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. 

2. RE

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world. The Python module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The re module raises the exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.
